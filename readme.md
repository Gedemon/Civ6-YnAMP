## Installation Instructions

If you run Civ6 on a PC, see [that forum post](https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/installation-instructions.655901/) above for installation instructions. Do not use the "releases" tab here, as it's not updated.

Mac **Steam** Users use the following command:

`cd ~/Library/Application Support/Sid Meier's Civilization VI/Mods/`

Mac **non-Steam** users use the following command:

`cd /Applications/Civ6.app/Contents/Assets/Base/Assets`

Once inside this directory, clone this repo with the following git command:

`git clone https://github.com/seelingcat/Civ6-YnAMP.git`

If you do not have git, it can be installed [here](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).

Enjoy!
